# HPC Processing

Many project require extensive processing of very large data files before an R based data analysis can begin.  Those steps should be captured in this directory.  Typically this would include

- Instructions on obtaining the raw data
- Shell scripts or pipeline code used to process the raw data
- README files documenting how to run the pipeline steps (perhaps showing the order of steps) and documenting any other commands that need to be run
