# Raw Data

This directory is for analysis ready files that we treat as raw data for the purpose of R analysis.  

Examples of data that belongs here are;

- Manually curated metadata about your samples (eg `sampletable.xlsx`)
- Raw data from instruments

Our assumption is that the data in here is too large to be checked in to git.  To make this data accessible to your end users you should add it to `data.list`
