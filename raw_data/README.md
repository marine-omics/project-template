# Raw Data

This directory is for raw data that is not too large to be checked in to git.  Don't put anything larger than a few mb in here. 

Examples of data that belongs here are;

- Manually curated metadata about your samples (eg `sampletable.xlsx`)
- Small datasets (eg field or laboratory observations manually entered in a spreadsheet)

Examples if data that doesn't belong here;

- Raw data from instruments (put it in a subdirectory of hpc/)
